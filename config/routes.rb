  # Sample of regular route:
  #   match 'products/:id' => 'catalog#view'
  # Keep in mind you can assign values other than :controller and :action

  # Sample of named route:
  #   match 'products/:id/purchase' => 'catalog#purchase', :as => :purchase

  # Sample resource route (maps HTTP verbs to controller actions automatically):
  #   resources :products

  #   resources :products do
  #     member do
